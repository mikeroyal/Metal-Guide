[OpenVR Benchmark on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/955610/OpenVR_Benchmark/) is the first benchmark tool for reproducibly testing your real VR performance, rendering inside of your VR headset.

[OpenHMD](http://www.openhmd.net/) is open source API and drivers that supports a wide range of HMD(head-mounted display) devices such as Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Sony PSVR, and others.

[openXR](https://www.khronos.org/OpenXR/) is a free, open standard that provides high-performance access to Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) collectively known as XR—platforms and devices.

[Monado](https://monado.dev/) is the first OpenXR™ runtime for GNU/Linux. Monado aims to jump-start development of an open source XR ecosystem and provide the fundamental building blocks for device vendors to target the GNU/Linux platform.

[Libsurvive](https://github.com/cntools/libsurvive) is a set of tools and libraries that enable 6 dof tracking on lighthouse and vive based systems that is completely open source and can run on any device. It currently supports both SteamVR 1.0 and SteamVR 2.0 generation of devices and should support any tracked object commercially available.

[Simula](https://github.com/SimulaVR/Simula) is a VR window manager for Linux that runs on top of Godot. It takes less than 1 minute to install. Simula is officially compatible with SteamVR headsets equipped with Linux drivers (e.g. HTC Vive, HTC Vive Pro, & Valve Index). We have also added experimental support to OpenXR headsets that have Monado drivers (e.g. North Star, OSVR HDK, and PSVR). Some people have gotten the Oculus Rift S to run Simula via OpenHMD ([see here](https://github.com/OpenHMD/OpenHMD/issues/225#issuecomment-638454156)).
